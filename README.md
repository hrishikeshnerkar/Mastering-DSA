## Starting My Algorithm Practice Journey: A Structured Approach to Interview Preparation

Starting today, I‚Äôm committing to practicing all major algorithm topics to strengthen my problem-solving skills and prepare thoroughly for technical interviews. Algorithms form the backbone of coding interviews, and mastering them is essential for success.

I plan to work through problems across a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- **Two Pointers**  
- **Sliding Window**  
- **Binary Search**  
- **Dynamic Programming**  
- **Greedy Algorithms**  
- **Graph Algorithms**  
- **Backtracking**  
- **Recursion**  
- **Stacks & Queues**  
- **Linked Lists**  
- **Trees & Tries**

Most problems fall within the **easy to medium** difficulty range, and once I understand the core concepts, I aim to solve them with minimal reliance on hints or editorials.

## üîç My Strategy

I‚Äôll be classifying problems into categories and identifying typical example problems for each topic. These examples will serve as a starting point to build a strong foundation. Once I‚Äôm confident with the basics, I‚Äôll apply those techniques to more complex problems.

I won‚Äôt be sharing my raw code here, but I highly recommend checking out the discussion sections of each problem‚Äîthere are many clean and insightful solutions contributed by the community.
